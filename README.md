# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Apurva Gundaria in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description
In this project, I explore the correlation between commodities and currencies of commodity-exporting countries. I not only explore the basic correlation but I also attempt to model out the relationship. In addition, I use rolling correlations to find episodes where the correlation changed greatly in any direction. I use these episodes to do background research on the underlying assets.
